            <b>Thoroughbred Project</b> <i>August 2024 - December 2024</i>
            <br/>
            Working with two clients at the Gluck Equine Research Center, 
			a group of students and I were tasked with improving on a website
			that allows the user to interface with a MySQL database. Firstly,
			we improved the searching functions by implementing a proper API 
			that can be called in order to retrieve a JSON containing all of
			a specific horse's data. Alongside updating the search back end, 
			we also improved on statistical functions that display the data in
			a more human-readable format. This was done using the Google Charts 
			library, which also allows a user to view subsections of the graph in 
			more detail. Finally, we updated the front end to be more in line with 
			the University of Kentucky's aesthetic.

            <b>Active Therapy Systems LLC (ATS)</b> <i>May 2022 - Jan 2023</i>
            <br/>
            At ATS I was responsible for creating code for multiple aspects of the both site and an android application.  
            On the site I wrote PHP for generating PDF files based on data given to me through an API call. I also helped in 
            creating a android application, I was responsible for making static helper classes and a graphing system that would map 
            out a patients blood pressure over time. Finally, I performed quality checks on the site and application to report 
            any major or minor bugs that may have appeared during development.

            </br>
            I made a calculator that does simple arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulo, trig, etc.)
            , and also allows the user to graph their equations on a 
            2D plane.

            <br/>
            This website is hosted on an Apache24 server located on my home computer. 
            All HTML, PHP, and JavaScript code running on this site has been developed by me. 
            Additionally, I have implemented a tunneling system using CloudFlared to bypass the need for a static IP address, 
            which would typically be provided by my ISP. I also have to do this because my ISP uses a system called CGNat,
            so my router's IP is not the public ip someone can use to visit this site.

            I created a JavaScript based webpage
            that allows users to retrieve weather data from 
            an online API based on latitude and longitude coordinates,
            along with their preferred units. Users can input these details, 
            and the site will display the relevant information.

            I created a bot that I can use on my discord server to generate pictures from the internet 
            based on a prompt given by any user. The bot can also act as a moderation tool by performing various administrator  
            tasks at a significantly quicker pace.

            I have undertaken various mini projects within Unity to explore the software's capabilities. Here are a few examples:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Developed a 2D game enabling players to navigate through a virtual museum showcasing NASA projects.
            <br/>
            2. Created an interactive walkthrough illustrating Supreme Court rulings on specific cases, providing insights into judges' opinions.
            <br/>
            3. Implemented simple AI behaviors within 2D environments to simulate enemy interactions against a player.
            <br/>
            4. Designed a basic battle arena game where the player combats endlessly spawning adversaries, testing combat mechanics and endurance.

            Within unreal engine I have created multiple small horror games with groups of 4 people. We created a game with a 
            simple objective of finding a key and escaping a monster in a large house. 
            We made a game where the player wanders into an abandonded mine where the entrance then colapses 
            behind them. The player must then make their way through the mine, avoiding any dangers that pop 
            up as they travel further in.

			<b>Natural Selection Simulator:</b><i>October 2024 - December 2024</i>
            </br>
			In python I made a simulation for natural selection. This 
			program uses individual neural networks to simulate how entities would 
			behave based on some sort of stimuli. After a set number of steps, a new generation
			is created based on the previous generation's survivors. This is done using a 
			genetic algorithm that splices genomes together. These new entities are then placed
			into the same environment where the process starts again. Eventually this will result in a 
			population that can best survive the environment they are placed into.

			<b>Rubix Cube Solver:</b> <i>October 2024</i>
            </br>
			Using Python, I created a rubix cube in a digital environment. 
			The cube contains functions to print it to command line, rotate a specific face, 
			and shuffle the cube. </br>
			The solver is an implementation of the A* algorithm. It generates a 
			tree of possible solutions to the rubix cube, and calculates how
			close a node may be by using a heursitic. The heursitic in the case is
			found by summing how many unique colors are on each side, then using the max value
			of the six sides minus one.

            <b>DBMS Project:</b><i>January 2024 - May 2024</i>
            <br/>
            A group of students and I had to compile and 
            manipulate an open source DBMS. We ended up 
            using FirebirdDB with the goal of creating 
            significantly faster query speeds on frequently used 
            queries. This was done by using a wrapper that would 
            moniter all used queries, and store the most common ones 
            in a cache. The queries were removed based on a TTL, and 
            eventually replaced. This showed significant gains in speed 
            by roughly 30%.
