				Update 1: Holy fuck. That was insane. Just gonna write out what I saw. First off, the entire room was covered in 
				images of some weird looking figure. I couldn't really make out any details but it(?) looked humanoid (I think). 
				I walked around the place a bit, and I found what looked like a rotting corpse, but it had no internals? Like it was just a flab 
				of skin laying on the ground. It definitly wasn't my friend though thaknfully. Really hoping they're okay. Some scary shit.
